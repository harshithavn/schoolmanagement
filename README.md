This project provides effective Student Information Maintenance System (SIMS). By using this
system college administrators and management can manage all students information, course
details, subject details and session details.
It has facilities to generate various types of reports, which are requiredby the management during
normal business operations to operate the business effectively.

The aim of our project is to develop a system that is meant to partially computerize the
work performed in the school board.
 The system would be having two logins: admin and user login. Admin can add student and
he can view student account details and can even add or update things in their account. Admin has
to feed the system with data into respective student account. The system then calculates for every
student and updates the information into their database every time of updation.
